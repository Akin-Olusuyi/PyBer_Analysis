# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The main purpose is to analyze and summarize  the PyBer data on how the data differs by city types in terms of the number of rides, fares and drivers. I then went further to focus the analysis on a shorter time frame between Jan to April 2019.

  - From the summary table, we can see that the Urban city definitely has a higher number of rides and drivers when compared to the Suburban and Rural cities.
  - On average PyBer rides are more expensive in Rural cities compared to other city types. The demand for rides and the relative low supply of drivers is a significant factor.
  - In terms of total revenue, the Urban cities generates the highest amount of revenue, then followed by Suburban cities and the Rural cities.
