# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The main purpose is to analyze and summarize  the PyBer data on how the data differs by city types in terms of the number of rides, fares and drivers. I then went further to focus the analysis on a shorter time frame between Jan to April 2019.

  - From the summary table, we can see that the Urban city definitely has a higher number of rides and drivers when compared to the Suburban and Rural cities.
  - On average PyBer rides are more expensive in Rural cities compared to other city types. The demand for rides and the relative low supply of drivers is a significant factor.
  - In terms of total revenue, the Urban cities generates the highest amount of revenue, then followed by Suburban cities and the Rural cities. 
  - From the line chart, while the total fares(revenue) for suburban and rural cities seems to be relatively flat, the Urban line seems to trending up over the duration of our analysis (Jan - Apr 2019)



## Summary

### Recommendation
- Urban cities definitely generates the most revenues as a result of having a huge demand for the service and high number of drivers. The overall strategy towards Urban cities is crucial to future of the company. More resources should be allocated to increasing the company's footprint in urban cities.
- Clearly something isn't quite right in rural cities. Need to strategically allocate some resources to advertising specifically to encourage more drivers which in turn should help bring down the average price per ride.
- From our line chart, there was a spike around the third week of february, the company should look into why that was and identify how to replicate or at least have more of those spikes in revenue.
